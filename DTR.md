Project:  Night Writer

Group Member Names:  Ron Huston and Erik Schneider

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
Answer - To complete the project and learn along the way.

Goals and expectations:

Team strengths:  Communication, willingness to ask questions, perspective

How to overcome obstacles:  Communication, break problems into smaller problems and tackle one at a time.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):  We'll work on the weekend to start (Saturday being the first day) and we'll assess from there.  We'll continue to work after class each day and continue to evaluate.  At this point, weekday lunch hours are individual.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):  We'll work side by side and talk through each step.  If scheduling conflicts arise, we will communicate by phone (for logistics) and determine how to work through Slack.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
This is still to be determined based on the project requirements.  Testing and GitHub are two areas where Erik will take more of a lead at the start to help teach the concepts.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):  For the most part, we will be working together and learning together.  Once we know more about the project, we can divide individual pieces to work on separately.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):We'll do all of this together and strengthen/learn.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:  Be honest.  If there is something that needs to be improved, don't be mean but be constructive.

Agenda to discuss project launch:  We will take Friday night to go through the project individually and "whiteboard it out".  When we meet in person on Saturday, we'll compare our individual notes and combine them into one.

Ideas:  working together is key

Tools:  Slack, google, youtube

Additional Notes:  A team working together is stronger together than individuals on their own.
